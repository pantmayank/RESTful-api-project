# RESTful-api-project

## Creating a simple server:

1. Run npm init to create a package.json file
2. Install express `npm i --save express`
3. Create server.js and app.js files
4. Run the files using `node server.js`
5. Check your json response at localhost:3000

- Each route goes into app.use() and are redirected to the required routes defined in the [api folder](api) . Desired request are managed using different RESTful-api defined in each specific route file.
